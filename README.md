# pdf-utilities


## Purpose

From time to time I need to manipulate PDF files for personal use: split, merge, rotate, compress.  
It's not something that warrants the use of specialized software, but I also don't want to use free online tools because of concerns about privacy, security, and added watermarks.  
A lot of stuff can be done with Python, so I used to run small scripts in the Python IDE on my desktop.  
I currently explore using Google Colab for this: I can use Python, it's free, there's runtime with enough RAM and disk storage, and I can share the notebook so that others could easily use it too.  
I want to collect here useful scripts for editing PDFs in Colab.

### Merge PDFs  
Merges several PDFs into one in an alphabetical order.  

### Pdf to Spreads  
Converts a PDF file with one page per spread (optimized for printing) into a PDF file with two pages per spread (optimized for reading on a widescreen). 

## How to use

Simply open it in Google Colab, create a copy, and follow instructions in the notebook.
